    "body": "This FLIP proposes to address a common source of confusion among Cadence users by decoupling the two parts of the reference expression: creating the reference and casting it to a type. Under this model, the `as` operator would only be a casting operator, while references would be created with `&v`. \r\n\r\nRelated work to this is https://github.com/onflow/cadence/pull/1566, which bans the use of `as!` and `as?` in reference expressions in the parser, as these do not function at runtime. \r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nFor contributor use:\r\n\r\n- [X] Targeted PR against `master` branch\r\n- [X] Linked to Github issue with discussion and accepted design OR link to spec that describes this work.\r\n- [X] Updated relevant documentation \r\n- [X] Re-reviewed `Files changed` in the Github PR explorer\r\n- [X] Added appropriate labels \r\n",

Capabilities are themselves a new concept that most Cadence programmers need to understand, but the API for syntax around Capabilities (especially the notion of “links” and “linking”), and the associated concepts of the public and private storage domains, lead to Capabilities being make this concept even more confusing and awkward to use. This proposal suggests that we could get rid of links entirely, and replace them with Capability Controllers (henceforth referred to as CapCons) which could make Capabilities easier to understand, and easier to work with.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "What happends when a user in BloctoApp clicks \"create new versus collection\"? As the creator of the versus contract, I do not know. \r\n\r\nIn the current state of cadence I see a trend where initializing the storage/link a solution/contracts requires is becomming more and more decentralized. The process of doing this is not standardized in any way and the owner of a contrat have no way of knowing if another product initializes the storages correctly. \r\n\r\nThis FLIP aims to suggest a solution where it would be possible for the owner of a contract to specify how it wants itself to be initialized in a user accounts. And also enable script access to this information.\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor contributor use:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Targeted PR against `master` branch\r\n- [ ] Linked to Github issue with discussion and accepted design OR link to spec that describes this work.\r\n- [ ] Updated relevant documentation \r\n- [ ] Re-reviewed `Files changed` in the Github PR explorer\r\n- [ ] Added appropriate labels \r\n",
